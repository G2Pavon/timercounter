Basically, there is a 'base' separated from the displays that you grab. Then you select a color you want and one of the four North-South-West-East facings and grab that too. Then just paste everything into your map and everything should be peachy.

Woof woof and Happy Mapping,

I disagree with Omilo in that the timer needs tweaking. I would claim the mapper/user need tweaking. And Omilo would have found any major bug like that 
since he betatested it...as well as when he betatested Godspeed, easy Corruo and hard Corruo. Right Omilo?   =)

Raver....oh dear. Where shall I start? Raver totally re-skins our timer without knowing what he is doing. 
The timer is properly documented on our forum and if you are going to skin the timer you should know what you are doing. 
Also, jumpers as well as mappers should read the readme file included with our maps. 
It states that if you are gonna geek the map you should make sure to let the timer initialize itself properly each round which may take a second or two. 
If you ignore that and press the start button WITHIN a few seconds after map restart, it may be buggy. 
And if you record a WR and find the timer leaves you with 0:00:00 showing then don't come crying and blame the timer.

If someone finds a bug which can be reproduced with the original files released, used properly as described, then we have a bug we can look at.

Regarding Raver; if he makes changes he should TEST that the timer still works properly. It is neither our fault nor responsibility if not the original is used. 
This goes for anyone tampering with the timer, this is nothing personal against Raver.

Since the timer has been used with Godspeed, Corruo easy and hard - and noone reported any bugs (apart from one instance where Omilo geeked a map) 
you will need someting to back up accusations of the timer not working. Kreedz is behind the timer and for all practical purposes it is the new official timer. 
As such it should be recommended to be used instead of as Faker wrote "use the old, original Kreedz timer for your maps".

I assume it was a case of bad judgement and jumping to conclusions though, and I trust Faker will rectify that statement.
10:32 รท. - Addicted 2 Boomsticks^SadPuppy: I want to stress the importance of checking the documentation if you want to skin it or replace buttons etc. 
And if you do stuff to it, do TEST it.


"The new timer seems to cause several problems (lags, fps problems and other major problems like showing 0:0:0 all the time)." 


As is clearly stated in the documentation, the timer uses sprites as the digits. 
If you as mapper place a lot of sprites in say an open area without proper visblocking you could get lag and fps drops of course. 
Blame the mapper for that 'feature' - not the timer. The "other major problems" indicated you will have to elaborate on since we are not aware of them.
Go away - there is no more text to read.
