This repository is dedicated to preserve and maintain all timers on a single web page. Typically, timers are downloaded from GameBanana (that page sucks nowadays) or shared by others mappers through forums or Discord.

  > - List of maps categorized by the timer they use (maps_with_spr1n_timer.txt, etc.). Analyze each BSP file and extract entities.

It might be possible to simplify the process by examining the targets, targetnames, etc., of the buttons, as each timer likely uses distinct key values for these entities.
