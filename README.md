- List of maps categorized by the timer they use (maps_with_spr1n_timer.txt, etc.). Analyze each BSP file and extract entities. Typically, maps that use the spr1n timer have a game text entity with the key value 'message' set to 'GL & HF! Timer by spr1n. It might be possible to simplify the process by examining the targets, targetnames, etc., of the buttons, as each timer likely uses distinct key values for these entities.
