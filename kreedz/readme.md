This is the first timer in kz history, the original, made by Kreedz himself (as far as is known). This particular version has been around on Xtreme-Jumps.eu since at least 2007. It appears it was edited by Raver, so it seems it's not the original. However, the modification is minor probably and any changes did not affect the original functionality.
