This is the first timer in kz history, the original, made by Kreedz himself (as far as is known). This particular version has been around on the Xtreme-Jumps.eu since at least 2007. It appears it was edited by Raver, so it seems it's not the original. However, I doubt it has been significantly modified, and any changes probably didn't affect the original functionality.
